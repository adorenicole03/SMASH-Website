    <h1>All About Me!!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Maya Nicole Farr and I am 15 years old. I like to write, dance,and do well in school. My personality is nice and I consider myself an introvert. I am mostly into science and technology. I also love dancing, listening to music, and do well in school. I like dancing because it makes me happy and it expresses my feelings. I also like to try new things and take risks. I like every color of the rainbow and I like any type of food that tastes good. I don't have a favorite singer but I like any music that sounds nice to me. I am also into to rap music but I dont have a favorite rapper. One fun fact about me is that I am willing to try everthing and I like to take risks. Also this summer I am attending a 5 week program called SMASH. SMASH stands for Summer Math and Summer Honors Academy and it is a 3 year commitment. I joined because I wanted to better my math and my communication skills. I want to get better at my communication skills because I not really good at hope you guys enjoy my page xoxo~Maya!<p></p>
