The birds were chirping the sun was shining &nbsp;and the wind sang as I walked in the breeze. &nbsp;On this day I was going to be dancing at the pep rally for spirit week. It was October and I was still new at being a 9th grader and I knew I was going to be even more nervous because I was going to be performing in front of the whole entire school. I didn&#39;t really know everyone yet and I could feel the sweat dripping down my body. &ldquo;As I walked in the school, a girl as</span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c1">ed me</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Is that really how you have your hair styled?&rdquo;I replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in an annoyed tone. I was annoyed because I didn&#39;t like how she came at me. At that point, I felt as hot as a boiling pot because I was very upset. In my mind I wanted to fight her but I realized that wasn&#39;t the right thing to do and I decided to be the bigger person. &ldquo;Slam!!&rdquo; went the door as I put my things into my locker. I decided to look down at my arm and I spotted my G</span><span class="c1">emini</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bracelet glowing in my eyesight. I knew that the bracelet was going to help me through my day. I started to calm down a little bit and I went through my classes and I felt ok. Then later on at the start of my lunch period, I start to get really dirty and nasty looks in the hallway as I was making my way &nbsp;to get my lunch. I also assume people were talking about me. At that moment I decided to turn back and walk the other way because I didn&#39;t feel like I was in the mood to eat anything. I didn&rsquo;t like it when people would &nbsp;point and stare at me. &nbsp;Deep down inside I was still insecure about my hair and at that point I wasn&#39;t liking the fact that I was different and I stood out from everyone else. I came home from school and I start talking to my mom and I told her what happened. She decides to help me and tells me that I have to be proud of my hair and be happy with the hair God blessed me with. She also tells me that your hair is you don&#39;t let anyone change it or talk bad about it. She then told me not to be like everyone else and that I always had to be myself and stay true to myself. Some of my friends tell me that I don&rsquo;t need to worry about what people have to say about you and continue with your life. I then started to realize that &ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s my hair not theirs.&rdquo; and I started to feel comfortable about my hair. People started to shower me with compliments about my hair. I began to embrace my natural hair and I learned that it was beautiful. One last thing</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;your hair is yo</span><span class="c1">u</span><span class="c0">; don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you how you should style it. </span></p><p class="c2 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
